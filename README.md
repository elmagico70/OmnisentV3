# Omnisent V3

This repository contains a Python backend under `backend/` and a new React + TypeScript frontend under `frontend/`.

The frontend was generated from TypeScript modules provided in the repository root and moved into `frontend/src/`. Configuration files for Vite and Tailwind are included to run or build the UI.

## Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend remains unchanged under the `backend/` directory.
